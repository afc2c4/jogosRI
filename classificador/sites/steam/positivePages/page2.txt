 Polish  Russian  Arabic  Japanese  Korean  Chinese  Dutch IntroductionWelcome to the Far Cry Arcade Editor  With this tool  you are able to make solo maps   player co op maps and multiplayer maps for up to   players  There are six game modes in total  Assault  Outpost  Journey  Bounty Hunt  Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch  What’s more  there are over   objects you can use from Far Cry   Far Cry   Far Cry Primal  Watch Dogs  Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed Unity to create any kind of map you like This guide will take you through the basic process of making your first map in each of these game modes  but in each case  you should take the time to explore all the options and settings the editor has to offer   You can add objects  enemies  animals  and health  weapon and ammo pickups  You can change the terrain  add water  underground areas  and change the weather  time of day  and other environment settings   And you can even fully customise up to four weapon and ammo loadouts to encourage different playstyles   Infinite maps  infinite fun – it all starts here Initial Map SetupAfter launching the Far Cry Arcade Editor choose the “New Map” option  The next window that appears will ask for the game mode  Each game mode requires specific game mode objects to be included to make sure the map can be played correctly  These are things like spawn points  objectives and extraction points  You can also choose the terrain type for your map  Once the map has been generated  you will find the game mode objects you need by first clicking on the Objects icon at the top of the screen  then selecting Game mode objects in the browser that opens on the right side of the screen  The Game mode objects panel appears at the bottom of this browser  Each game mode will have a different list of objects AssaultIn Assault  the objective is to eliminate all enemies on the map To set up an Assault map  you need two elements A spawn point – this is where your character starts on the map at the beginning of a mission You’ll find the Spawn Point object under Game mode objects  After clicking on its thumbnail  you can place the Spawn Point by clicking in the map where you want to place itAI enemies – these are your mission objective You can place enemies in the map by clicking on the AI Management icon right next to the Objects icon  In this menu  you can select the type of AI that you want to place  which factions they belong to  enemies  allies  neutral or animals  what type of character they are  and at which time the AI appears during the missionsFor Assault  it is required that you have at least one AI on the map belonging to the Enemies faction  in Wave  The ‘waves’ system  as its name indicates  spawns enemies in waves  Enemies placed in Wave   will already be present in the map when the player enters it  You can use the “Trigger” option in the AI management screen when a wave is selected  except for Wave   to choose when that wave should start spawning  It can be set to spawn when one enemy from the previous wave is dead    of that wave is dead    or  With these spawn points and enemies in place  you will be ready to start a basic round of Assault  Now you’re ready to find the theme and flavour of your map by adding objects  editing the terrain  and more OutpostSimilarly to Assault  the aim is to eliminate all enemies in the map  But the introduction of the alarm post object adds some more requirements to your map creation  Here are the required elements to create an Outpost map A spawn point  See Assault section above An alarm post  which the enemy AI from Wave   will try to reach and use if they detect the player  The alarm can be added to the map in the same way as the spawn point  by selecting its thumbnail in the Game mode objects folder  and placing it in your map  Be careful to make sure it’s reachable for the enemy AI from Wave   AI enemies  See Assault section above In Outpost  Wave   of enemies can only be triggered if the alarm has been sounded  This happens if the player is detected and the enemy AI reaches the alarm post  Waves   to   can use the same triggers as described in the Assault section above Remember  alarms and Waves   of enemies are optional  depending on how difficult you want the map to be You can also change some of the modifiers that can increase the challenge  Click the Gameplay Modifiers icon in the top row of the main window to see the list  For example  Game Over on Detection will force players to remain stealthy at all times  And a time limit with the Countdown modifier to increase the pressure even further JourneyThe objective in Journey is to simply reach the exit from your starting location  Here are the elements required A spawn point  See Assault section above An exit  called an extraction zone  which can be found in the Game mode objects folder  The map is completed once the player enters that area  You can resize this object by accessing its Object preferences and using the   sliders Those two elements are the only requirements to create a Journey map  However  the real fun of a Journey map is making the rest of the map interesting to navigate through  You can make the map as open or maze like as you want  And you can add enemies or animals for challenge or flavour Bounty HuntIn Bounty Hunt maps  you must eliminate a specific target enemy  or multiple target enemies  before reaching the exit These maps require three elements to be ready for gameplay A spawn pointTarget enemy AI – your mission objectiveNo matter how many enemy AI characters you use in a Bounty Hunt mission  at least one of them must be defined as a target The first step is to add AI to the map   See Assault section above To set an AI as a target  select the Target icon to the left of Objects at the top of the screen  You can add or remove AI to the list of targets by clicking on them in the map  The following AI can be set as targets EnemiesMost animals  except fish  birds  and some other exceptions An exit  called the extraction zone in the editor  See Journey section above Your Bounty Hunt mission will be ready once these three conditions have been set  Try and find fun ways to position your targets in the map and feel free to add additional enemies or animals to challenge the player You can also make the map easier by applying Targets Visible from Start from the Gameplay Modifiers list  click the Gameplay Modifiers icon at the top of the screen to see the list  Without this modifier  players will have to use their binoculars to find and tag the targets – and it’s up to you if you want to give players the binoculars or not in the first place DeathmatchDeathmatch is a no nonsense free for all with a simple goal  kill more players than everybody else within the given time limit  Reaching the score sooner will end the match early  Eliminated players return to the fray at a random spawn point moments later to continue accumulating points until the round has reached its end Setting up a Deathmatch requires one gameplay element A Deathmatch map needs at least twelve spawn points  found in the Game mode objects folder More spawn points means more possible locations to spawn at With twelve or more spawn points in place  your Deathmatch map is ready to go  There is a default Countdown  time limit  and Score to Reach which can be adjusted in the Gameplay Modifiers list Also consider adding multiple loadouts so that players can experiment with different playstyles  Click the Loadouts icon in the top of the screen to explore and experiment with different weapons  ammo types  throwables  gear  health  and the ability boosting homeopathics Team DeathmatchTeam Deathmatch is a classic team based battle  Two teams of up to   players each compete to rack up the most kills in the time limit The requirements for this game mode are similar to the standard Deathmatch Team Deathmatch requires a minimum of twelve spawn points  at least six for Team   and at least six for Team  Spawn Point Team   and Spawn Point Team   can be found in the Game mode objects folder You also have the option to add mixed spawn points to switch things up  These are spawn points where players from either team can randomly respawn during the match You can add them by using the Spawn Point Multi  also found in the Game mode objects browser  in the same way as the Team   and Team   spawn points Just like Deathmatch  you’ll be ready to go with twelve starting positions on a Team Deathmatch map   Also like Deathmatch  you can adjust the default Countdown  time limit  and Score to Reach  For Loadouts  you can give the same loadouts to each team  or set different loadouts for an asymmetrical experience  Gameplay Modifiers can also be global  or per team For all game modes  it’s also necessary to take a snapshot of your map  which will be displayed as a thumbnail for your map  This thumbnail will be visible for other players when they browse maps  or in a lobby when it’s time to vote for a map  To take the snapshot  click on the “Map properties” icon on top of the screen  and select “Capture” after placing the camera where you want to    comments Read more   March NEW   Far Cry     Launch Gameplay Trailer   Your chance to take back Hope County is almost here  Check out the new Launch
