Fixed soft lock when the player parries and dies at the same time  Fixed issue where game appears in a tiny resolution  Fixed rare issue where loading screen plays forever  Fixed Cagney Carnation face attack so it consistently has proper anticipation cue timingAdditionally  we are now offering a "Legacy" branch of Cuphead under the Betas tab in the properties window  The Legacy branch of Cuphead will be the exact launch build of Cuphead  with no applied patches and no future support  It contains all of the exploits and bugs of the launch version and is available for those who prefer to play that version  WARNING   Switching to the Legacy version of Cuphead may corrupt or erase your present saves  The Legacy version and Current version of Cuphead share the same pool of saves and moving between the two of them has a high probability of corrupting or erasing your present Cuphead saves  StudioMDHR offers no present or future support for the Legacy version of Cuphead  Use it at your own risk     comments Read more   December    Cupdate   Patch v  Hello friends Where has the time gone  We ve been hard at work over the last couple of months squashing bugs  fixing exploits  and even
